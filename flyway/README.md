# Flyway

## Migrations

This directory contains migrations for the National Provider Directory FHIR API to be managed by Flyway.
When schema changes are needed, they are to be defined using SQL scripts and placed here following this naming scheme:

```bash
V<VERSION_NO>__<describe_the_change>.sql
```

Where `VERSION_NO` is an ascending value describing the order in which to apply the migration scripts. The version number
is followed by two underscore characters. Some examples:

```bash
V1__initial_schema.sql
V2__add_new_address_type.sql
V2_1__correct_new_address_type.sql # note that version number `2_1` is OK!
V3__add_new_provider.sql
```

The contents of each script are a valid SQL statement e.g.

```sql
---
Adds a address table to the npd schema
---
CREATE TABLE npd.address (
    id uuid NOT NULL,
    barcode_delivery_code character varying(12),
    smarty_key character varying(10),
    address_us_id uuid,
    address_international_id uuid,
    address_nonsta,ndard_id uuid
);
```

Flyway keeps track of what migrations have been performed by updating a migration metadata table in the database. 
For local development, Flyway will check to see if any migrations need to be performed (updating the database accordingly) 
on `docker compose up`.

## Inserts

This directory contains repeatable migrations that add fixture data. These are also implemented valid SQL statements.
Repeatable migrations have a different naming scheme:

```bash
R__<describe-the-sample-data>.sql
```
